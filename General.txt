-> /proc/devices: 
    It contains the character and block devices
    with their major number.

-> Why character devices are called character devices?
    Because the read/write operation done is in size of
    byte.

-> Why block devices are called block devices?
    Because the read/write operation done is in size of
    block.

-> To read bytes of a devices
    use:
    hexdump /dev/<device_name> 

    to see only few bytes 
    Use:
    hexdump /dev/<device_name> | head

    Use:
    mknod <device-name> <type of device 'c' or 'b'> <major-num> <minor-num>
